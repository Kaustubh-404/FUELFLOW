## Features
- **Gasless Transactions**: Users can send and receive funds without paying transaction fees, making the process accessible for newcomers to crypto.
- **Unique QR Code Generation**: Each transaction generates a QR code representing a private-public key pair, simplifying the transfer process.
- **Predicate Mechanism**: Funds are sent to a predicate address, ensuring security and privacy in transactions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application aims to provide a seamless experience similar to traditional finance apps like Revolut and Cash App.

## How It Works
1. **QR Code Generation**: The sender generates a unique QR code that consists of a private-public key pair. The public key creates a predicate address for fund transfers.
2. **Fund Transfer**: The sender transfers funds to the predicate address. The QR code is sent to the recipient.
3. **Receiving Funds**: Upon scanning the QR code, the recipient obtains the private key, allowing them to generate the same predicate and address.
4. **Transaction Creation**: The recipient creates a transaction specifying the predicate address and uses their signature to prove ownership of the private key.
5. **Blockchain Execution**: The transaction is sent to the Fuel blockchain, executing without requiring the user's signature, and the recipient receives the funds without incurring gas fees.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Fuel
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Solidity
- **Frontend**: React Native (or any preferred framework)
- **QR Code Generation**: [qrcode library](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/) (or similar)

## Future Goals
- Refine the application based on user feedback.
- Implement additional security features.
- Explore cross-chain transfer capabilities.
- Expand to support more cryptocurrencies.
